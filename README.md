# SofDes_Midterm_Erhardt1: "The Right Stuff"
What is the right stuff? The right stuff is a term to represent the qualities possessed by NASA astronauts that make them deemed fit for the job. For our project, we wanted to look at how this concept of the right stuff has evolved over the past sixty years. We accomplished this through a detailed analysis of various astronaut characteristics. We focused most heavily on education, military involvement, and gender. The full report can be found in computationalessay.ipynb.

*note* make a function obtain.py and put functions to obtain data in there.

functions.py has functions that can used to clean, manipulate, and visualize the data.

pytests.py contains the unit tests we ran on our data.

##Requirements Before Running
To run all of the functions you must have:
1. Install the kaggle API (https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) and create an API Token. Place the file in the location ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json. This is used to obtain the data (https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/astronaut-yearbook).
2. Download the zipfile module to unzip the data.
3. Download the matplotlib.puplot, pandas, itertools, math, and numpy modules. These are used to create the visualizations.
